This is an installation guide for what I hope will be the best possible linux system.
It's meant to be extremely low resource demanding while being able to pack all the punches of high-end systems.

    OS: Artix x86_64
    Init Sys: runit
    Kernel: Linux
    Shell: Fish
    WM: csm (calm window manager)
    Display Server: XLibre
    Terminal: stw
